/**
 * Miscellaneous unrelated variables and utils.

 * The file should not contain normal CSS rules - it is designed to be included via @import into other LESS files
 * as a library. Place here variable declarations and mixins only.
 * Be sure to put parenthesis after each mixin name, even if no parameters are required - this will suppress mixin output
 * (for details see http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature-not-outputting-the-mixin)
 * Most parametric mixins can accept unitless parameters in which case px is used as a default unit.
